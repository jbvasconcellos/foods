# Personal diet Project

This repository contains a project I am developing about the macronutrients and fibers' contents on different foods.

As many other people around the word, I spent a few months at home due to the present pandemic crisis. Luckly, I have been among those privileged ones who have remained safe enough, and who could use this time to reflect on different aspects of their lifes. In particular, in this time I decided to give a better look at my diet and eating habits (after three year living in Italy and having just returned from a long visit to my mom's and to my grandma's, lets just say I was in need of doing so!).

In this python project, built on a Jupiter notebook, I created visualization tools describing the nutritional value of foods I eat the most. It concentrates on their caloric values, macronutrients (i.e., carbohydrates, fats and proteins) and fibers. My main goal was to visualize the caloric composition of each food in terms of macronutrients.

The notebook in available for visualization as the file food.ipynb, and I used the data contained in the foods_dataset.csv file.

For this project I have chosen to use data I had collected myself, instead of mining a dataframe from the internet, since I am interested in the food that I eat on a daily basis. Although similat datasets can be easily found online, I find that many contain foods I seldon consume, or lack others that are on the basis of my diets.
